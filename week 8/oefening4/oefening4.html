    <p>Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you
        very much. They were the last people you&prime;d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
        because they just didn&prime;t hold with such nonsense.</p>
    <p>Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
        any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
        usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences,
        spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy
        anywhere.</p>
    <p>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody
        would discover it. They didn&prime;t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter
        was Mrs Dursley&prime;s sister, but they hadn&prime;t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she
        didn&prime;t have a sister, because her sister and her good&ndash;for&ndash;nothing husband were as unDursleyish
        as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived
        in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This
        boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn&prime;t want Dudley mixing with a child like
        that.</p>
    <p>When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy
        sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr
        Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she
        wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.</p>
    <p>None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window.</p>
    <p>At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley
        goodbye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. &lsquo;Little
        tyke,&rsquo; chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four&prime;s
        drive.</p>
    <p>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar &ndash; a cat reading a
        map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn&prime;t realise what he had seen &ndash; then he jerked his head around to
        look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn&prime;t a map in sight.
        What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at
        the cat. It stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his
        mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive &ndash; no, looking at the sign; cats couldn&prime;t
        read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards
        town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.</p>
    <p>But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning
        traffic jam, he couldn&prime;t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.
        People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn&prime;t bear people who dressed in funny clothes &prime; the get&ndash;;ups
        you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering
        wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly
        together. Mr Dursley was enraged to that a couple of them weren&prime;t young at all; why, that man had to be
        older than he was, and wearing an emerald&ndash;green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley
        that this was probably some silly stunt &ndash; these people were obviously collecting for something - yes, that
        would be it. The traffic moved on, and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his
        mind back on drills.
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    <p>Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn&prime;t, he might
        have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn&prime;t see the owls swooping past in broad
        daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open&ndash;mouthed as owl after owl sped
        overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at night&ndash;time. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly
        normal, owl&ndash;free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls
        and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunch-time, when he thought he&prime;d stretch his legs
        and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the baker&prime;s opposite.</p>
    <p>He&prime;d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker&prime;s. He
        eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn&prime;t know why, but they made him uneasy. This lot were whispering
        excitedly, too, and he couldn&prime;t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a
        large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.<br/>
        The Potters, that&prime;s right, that&prime;s what I heard &ndash;&rsquo;<br/>
        &lsquo;&ndash; yes, their son, Harry &ndash;&lsquo;</p>
    <p>Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to
        them, but thought better of it.</p>
